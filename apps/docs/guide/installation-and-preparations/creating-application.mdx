## Initiating a Wapi.js project

### Chat bot

The first step to build a wapi.js based chat bot is to create a new node.js project. You can quickly setup a new project using the utility NPM package provided with the wapi.js SDK only, run the following command in your terminal to setup the project: 

```bash
pnpm create-wapi-app my-whatsapp-bot
```

<Check>Once you run this command, you would be asked a couple of questions like the name of the project and whether you want to use typescript or javascript for this project. Once you answer them, you project will start to setup and once done. You can navigate to the project directory and start building your chat bot.</Check>

### Other use cases


- You are a developer and want to integrate the whatsapp business API with your existing backend.
- You are a solution partner or a tech partner with WhatsApp and want to access the WhatsApp business API to build a solution for your clients.

To do so, you can install the wapi.js SDK using the following command:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add @wapijs/wapi.js
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="yarn">
  ```bash
    yarn add @wapijs/wapi.js
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="npm">
  ```bash
    npm install @wapi/wapi.js
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
